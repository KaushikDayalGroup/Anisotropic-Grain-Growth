Anisotropic grain growth driven by the experimental grain boundary energy for Nickle microstructure using Threshold Dynamics.
Read experimental microstructures and fitted equation on experimental grain boundary energy table function of the unit normal of the boundary for Nickle microstructure, compute anisotropic kernel based on the grain boundary fitted equation, model grain growth with anisotropic Threshold Dynamics, and write the simulated microstructure. This work follows the anisotropic threshold dynamics algorithm in Elsey, Matt, and Selim Esedoḡlu.
